# ECE332 Fur Elise Melody Generator
Utilizing ATTiny2313 and piezo buzzers to play Fur Elise Melody

## Intended Use
The purpose of the Für Elise Melody Clip is to produce a two-voice melody, to be used in a
greeting card. The song is played through the use of two PS1420P02CT piezo buzzers, after the
press of a push-button. The prototype is programmed to play 20 seconds of Beethoven’s Fur Elise
at a moderato tempo, with the two buzzers playing two different octaves.

## Operating Conditions
Operating voltage range of the device: 1.8V to 5.5V
Operating temperature: -55ºC to +125ºC
Storage temperature: -65ºC to +150ºC
Maximum DC Current per I/O pin: 40.0mA

## Setup instructions
To operate the device, connect VCC (Pin 20) to a voltage source that is within the operating
voltage range (1.8V to 5.5V), and GND (Pin 10) to ground. Press button to play the song
interval. Refer to the KiCAD schematic for full details.
